# first-hugo

This is my first Hugo site. I'm just following some tutorials here.

## What I have done

1. Created a Hugo site & used the default theme
2. Added Vite.js and React to add some custom components
3. Added [Fireship's flamethrower](https://github.com/fireship-io/flamethrower) *(I know it's in "meme" status, but it works pretty well)*
4. Using [r2wc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@r2wc/react-to-web-component) to easily "translate" React components into Web Components for use in Hugo HTML and Markdown

> [!NOTE]
> Everything I've done is greatly inspired from the [fireship.io website](https://github.com/fireship-io/fireship.io/)
